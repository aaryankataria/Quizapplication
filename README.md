I have used React.js and Node.js to create this quiz application.

To store the data I have used firebase. 

Deployment steps
1. Open the folder in your preferred working environment.
2. Open terminal and type "npm install" inside the folder and wait for the dependecies to install.
3. After it finishes, type "npm start" and wait for it run your local host. 
4. Completing the last step will open the app in your browser. IF NOT, then visit "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser and run the app manually.
5. Sign in on the application. IF you are a first time visitor then sign up on the application and then sign in using your id and password.
